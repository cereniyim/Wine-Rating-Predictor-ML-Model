South Africa,"Winemaker: Louis Nel. This Cab-Shiraz blend is somewhat closed at present, with muted dark-fruit aromas that suggest blackberry, boysenberry and plum. Mouthfilling, gripping tannins produce a tight, firm structure, while hints of blackcurrant liqueur, bittersweet chocolate and cigar box softly unfold on the close. This should develop and become more pronounced with some time in the cellar; try after 2020.",91,,Stellenbosch,,Lauren Buzzeo,Louis Nel 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Rapscallion Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Stellenbosch),Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz

US,"Made in the popular modern style, this is a particular success. It shows ultraconcentrated orange, apricot, green apple and peach flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture, and a strong coating of oak brings layers of butterscotch, buttered toast and vanilla.

These flavors also play generously on the concentrated rich midpalate where they are countered by aromatic orange and tangerine zestiness, creating a lovely contrast and exciting richness. There is just a touch of residual sweetness here to create some drama, but it works to great effect. The wine is not sweet enough for deserts but will work with Asian spices or ripe cheeses.

They have largely succeeded, although it's a very different style than you'll find from anything on the coast.

US,"Longtime value producer Firesteed has another winner. This pretty Pinot shows excellent ripeness and full-bodied fruit flavor, thanks to the southern-Oregon components. Strawberries and tart raspberries come through cleanly, with a touch of cola in the aftertaste.",88,17.0,Oregon,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Firesteed 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),Pinot Noir
France,"Offers an intriguing nose with ginger, lime and floral elements. The mouthfeel is ephemeral—almost too light—but there’s a good case to be made for this style when bubbles are involved. Green apple, an almost lilac note, and lime on the palate. Finishes nicely, too.",91,27.0,Champagne,Champagne,,H.Germain NV Cuvée Prestige  (Champagne),Champagne Blend

US,"Bold and unconventional, there's nothing quite like this late-harvest wine. Made from Sémillon grapes left to ripen and shrivel through midwinter, it's deeply concentrated with dried mango and orange-peel flavors. Fermentation via natural yeast on its skins lends a deeply phenolic astringency to the palate. It's dusty and mineral with a sherried aldehydic character attributable to deliberate oxidation in barrels, yet somehow, it maintains a luminous core of fresh fruit. A curious and thought-provoking wine for the adventurous wine lover.",89,40.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Anna Lee C.

Australia,"Worth the effort to find, this wine shows terrific balance in every respect. Subtle oak and spice frame ripe cherry fruit on the nose. Refreshing herb and spice elements add zest to cherry and cola flavors on the palate, where the wine is fleshy without being at all heavy.

The blend of 87% Malbec, 12% Merlot and 1% Tannat presents powerful tannins and generous fruitiness.

Italy,"It's hard to imagine naturally tannic Sagrantino as a dessert wine but indeed this native Umbrian red grape was traditionally made in a sweet style to soften its firm astringency.

On the palate, a very generous full-fruited picture unfolds: there is very ripe juicy yellow pear and countless juicy citrus notions of clementine, tangerine, satsuma and orange. All of this is cut with precise, tart and ripe lemon freshness. This interplay of tart and ripe creates tension and drive. This is lovely now but is a powerhouse of potent long-lasting fruit.

It is a 50/50 blend of the 2008 and 2009 vintage—a crafty winemaker decision that has worked beautifully. The wine strikes a perfect balance, neither too young and sharp, nor too soft and fruity.

Vastly rich, it defines the Harlan Estate style, although, in this vintage, perhaps not quite at its highest expression. Nonetheless the wine is fat and unctuous and immediately drinkable, thanks to refined tannins.

US,"The round, forward scents and flavors of buttery popcorn dominate this vineyard designate, and that buttery note carries all the way into and around the finish. Though it spent just nine months in 20% new French oak, the palate and flavors suggest that it went through full malolactic.

US,"You'd never confuse this with a California Chard. Well, Anderson Valley, maybe. It's a cool-climate wine. Aromas of fresh, cold green apples, with what seems like an overlay of buttery oak. Brilliantly dry and crisp in the mouth. It's all about acidity here; flavors are secondary.

US,"Aromas of white pepper and pear start it off, and it smells snappy and inviting. The palate is all about grapefruit and orange; in a word, it's citrusy.

It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, with flavors of sour-cherry candy, red currant, licorice and spicy cola. Ninety-five percent new oak lends this a wonderful toastiness.

US,"A lovely Riesling, made in the German style. It's dryish, low in alcohol, high in racy acidity and tantalizing in flavor, with suggestions of citrus fruits, wildflowers, minerals and a distinct touch of petrol.

US,This is a standout in this price range. The well-defined cherry/cranberry fruit is wrapped in fresh rosemary and tarragon spices; the tannins are polished and there is an intriguing scent of pine forest that permeates the finishing flavors also.

US,"From grapes grown at some of the Willamette Valley's highest elevations, this is a pungent mix of citrus oil, grapefruit, metal shavings and stone. The flavors persist along that path, crafting a sleek and distinctive wine that in many ways is the antithesis of the fleshy, jammy, fruit-forward style of many domestic Pinots.",91,65.0,Oregon,McMinnville,Paul Gregutt,Penner-Ash 2014 Aegrina Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),Pinot Noir

Portugal,"A blend of Baga and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a powerful wine. Densely tannic and firmly dry, it is also rich and structured. The acidity from the black currant fruitiness shows strongly.

That combination of opposites gives it intellectual interest, a wine worth thinking and talking about. Technically, it's dry, fairly high in alcohol and oaky. The 100% Cabernet grapes off the estate are incredibly concentrated in black currants and cassis, showing their sunny, high elevation origins on Pritchard Hill. The wine is not perfect.

US,"The closest thing in California you can get to a great French Chablis, this is absolutely dry, high in acidity and streamlined.

Austria,"The finely tuned sweetness of this Auslese brings out the muskier notes of apple: a mix of fresh and baked fruit, with peeled skin and compote flesh. Initially, there still is the spectre of yeast but with some time there are hints of burnt sugar and apricot compote, too. A lovely, engulfing apple tartness makes this as suited to baked fruit desserts and fruit tarts as to creamy, ripe cheeses. Full marks for poise and freshness. This is a baby still and will need time to come into its own and unfold even more layers.

US,"The Ukiah Valley gets hot, no doubt, but 15.8% alcohol on a Mendocino Cabernet is still hard to take.

US,"A vertical red stripe reads “Twentieth Anniversary” along the left side of the front label. One suspects that such a milestone receives special care, and this certainly shows it. Aromatic with scents of cherries and blossoms, this is supported on a firm, almost steely frame of acid and tannin, and dotted with hints of herb and seed and grain.

It's a smooth, elegant, classic mountain Cab, that's dry and tannic, with delicious blackberry, currant and sweet-smoky oak flavors.

Only 225 cases were produced, but it's worth a search if you're looking for classic mountain Cabernet capable of extended aging. The wine has a linearity that defines elegance, yet is rich in blackberries and cassis, with oak nuances. Containing small quantities of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot for complexity, it will reward aging until at least 2018, and should be going strong in 2030.",96,80.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,,Dyer 2010 Dyer Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Cabernet Sauvignon

Time and airing help the wine plenty, and sooner rather than later it shows typical Rioja dried red fruits, earth, tobacco and spice. Astringent and tight as a drum now, but it will evolve in the bottle and should last another two decades.

A sweetie for sure, but not offensive.",84,12.0,Levante,Valencia,Michael Schachner,Spanish Vines NV La Loca Vino Espumoso Sparkling (Valencia),Sparkling Blend

US,"This is a gorgeous Cabernet, but it's pretty young, and while it's delicious now due to the ripe fruit, it really needs time. Wrapped in fresh, tight tannins, it displays powerful red and black currant, blackberry, cherry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, and shows the elegant, important mouthfeel of a top Napa Cab.

Italy,"Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration.

Fresh yet a little fleshy, with a long, zesty finish. Drink as soon as possible to capture the essence of a fine vintage.",90,23.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,Michael Schachner,José Pariente 2009 Verdejo (Rueda),Verdejo
Israel,"Light straw in the glass, this wine has aromas of pineapple and lemon zest. Refreshing on the palate, it offers flavors of clementine, lemon, orange rind, and honeysuckle. The finish features a lasting sense of brightness.",88,12.0,Dan,,Mike DeSimone,Barkan 2014 Classic Chardonnay (Dan),Chardonnay
Argentina,This gold-colored stale-smelling Torrontés smells like old apple juice. A chunky flat palate offers bland oxidized bitter flavors. Remnants of apple barely help a bitter finish.,81,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,Cuatro Vacas Gordas 2015 Torrontés (Mendoza),Torrontés
Germany,"Ebullient floral and honey notes bolster the intense, ripe, fleshy mango and peach flavors in this powerful Riesling. Full bodied and remarkably dry in style, with a richly textured, almost feathered mouthfeel. It finishes exceptionally long, with a bristle of lemon-lime acidity.",93,68.0,Rheingau,,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Johannishof 2010 Rüdesheim Berg Rottland Erstes Gewächs Riesling (Rheingau),Riesling
France,"The fruit bursts out of the glass, while the supporting tannins give power and intensity to this concentrated wine. It has all the richness of 2005, backed with juicy red fruits and some vibrant acidity. Age this wine, although its generous character means you could drink it in 5 years. Not available in the U.S.",92,,Burgundy,Echézeaux,Roger Voss,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005  Echézeaux,Pinot Noir
US,"There's a noticeable tilt of barrel reduction in this wine that keeps it more closed-off than desired. Otherwise, the experience is full bodied in baked bread and black cherry, with a tangy freshness to the finish.",87,30.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,Krutz 2014 Magnolia Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Pinot Noir
France,"This perfumed, herbal blend of Syrah and Grenache is tight and very crisp. It has intense tangy acidity and a lively fruity aftertaste. This is a bone-dry rosé with a desire for food.",86,19.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,Roger Voss,Château Roquefeuille 2016 Rosé in the Air Rosé (Côtes de Provence),Rosé
Spain,"Berry candy and licorice aromas become more subtle and earthy with air. It feels grabby and abrasive as many Toro's are prone to be, with blackberry and root notes and a sugar beet flavor. The slightly hot, candied finish holds onto that rooty character.",88,32.0,Northern Spain,Toro,Michael Schachner,Monte Hiniesta 2009  Toro,Tinta de Toro
Australia,"This blend of 70% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 5% Mourvèdre features surprisingly dark fruit flavors akin to blackberries and cola. A hint of mint or eucalyptus enlivens the bouquet and helps to lighten this otherwise rather full-bodied, brooding wine. Finishes long, with enough dusty tannins to warrant cellaring through 2015.",90,65.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Joe Czerwinski,D'Arenberg 2005 The Ironstone Pressings G-S-M (McLaren Vale),G-S-M
